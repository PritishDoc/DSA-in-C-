K Sum Paths
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 44.73%Submissions: 106K+Points: 4
Given a binary tree and an integer k, determine the number of downward-only paths where the sum of the node values in the path equals k. A path can start and end at any node within the tree but must always move downward (from parent to child).

Examples:

Input: k = 7   

Output: 3
Explanation: The following paths sum to k 
 
Input: k = 3
   1
  /  \
2     3
Output: 2
Explanation:
Path 1 : 1 -> 2 (Sum = 3)
Path 2 : 3 (Sum = 3)
Constraints:

1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 104
-100 ≤ node value ≤ 100
-109 ≤ k ≤ 109
