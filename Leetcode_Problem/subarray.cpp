Difficulty: HardAccuracy: 57.94%Submissions: 11K+Points: 8
Given an array arr[] and two integers say, x and y, find the number of sub-arrays in which the number of occurrences of x is equal to the number of occurrences of y.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 1] , x= 1 , y = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: The possible sub-arrays have same equal number of occurrences of x and y are:
1) [1, 2], x and y have same occurrence(1).
2) [2, 1], x and y have same occurrence(1).
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 1] , x = 4 , y = 6
Output: 6
Explanation: The possible sub-arrays have same equal number of occurrences of x and y are:
1) [1], x and y have same occurrence(0).
2) [2], x and y have same occurrence(0).
3) [1], x and y have same occurrence(0).
4) [1, 2], x and y have same occurrence(0).
5) [2, 1], x and y have same occurrence(0).
6) [1, 2, 1], x and y have same occurrence(0).
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 1] , x= 1 , y = 4
Output: 1
Explanation: The possible sub-array have same equal number of occurrences of x and y is: [2], x and y have same occurrence(0)
Constraints: 
1 <= arr.size() <= 106
1 <= arr[i], x, y<=106
