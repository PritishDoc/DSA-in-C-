K Closest Points to Origin
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 74.36%Submissions: 2K+Points: 4
Given an array of points where each point is represented as points[i] = [xi, yi] on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance, defined as: 

sqrt( (x2 - x1)2 + (y2 - y1)2 )

Note: You can return the k closest points in any order, driver code will sort them before printing.

Examples:

Input: k = 2, points[] = [[1, 3], [-2, 2], [5, 8], [0, 1]]
Output: [[-2, 2], [0, 1]]
Explanation: The Euclidean distances from the origin are:
Point (1, 3) = sqrt(10)
Point (-2, 2) = sqrt(8)
Point (5, 8) = sqrt(89)
Point (0, 1) = sqrt(1)
The two closest points to the origin are [-2, 2] and [0, 1].
Input: k = 1, points = [[2, 4], [-1, -1], [0, 0]]
Output: [[0, 0]]
Explanation: The Euclidean distances from the origin are:
Point (2, 4) = sqrt(20)
Point (-1, -1) = sqrt(2)
Point (0, 0) = sqrt(0)
The closest point to origin is (0, 0).
Constraints:

1 <= k <= points.size() <= 105
-104 <= xi, yi <= 104
