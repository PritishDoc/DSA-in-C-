# DSA Practice Repository

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice repository! This repository is dedicated to solving and organizing practice questions from popular platforms like LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks. Here, you will find a structured collection of DSA problems categorized by topics and difficulty levels.

## Introduction

This repository is designed to help anyone who is preparing for coding interviews or looking to improve their problem-solving skills in DSA. By practising these questions, you will better understand various data structures and algorithms, and how to apply them to solve complex problems.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized in a way that each topic has its own directory. Within each topic directory, problems are further categorized by difficulty levels: `Easy`, `Medium`, and `Hard`. Each problem has its subdirectory containing the problem statement, solution, and any additional notes or explanations.
