Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 42.12%Submissions: 209K+Points: 4
Given a grid of size n*m (n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns in the grid) consisting of '0's (Water) and '1's(Land). Find the number of islands.

Note: An island is either surrounded by water or the boundary of a grid and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically or diagonally i.e., in all 8 directions.

Examples:

Input: grid = [[0,1],[1,0],[1,1],[1,0]]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The grid is-

All lands are connected.
Input: grid = [[0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,1,1,0,1,0]]
Output: 2
Expanation:
The grid is-
 
There are two islands :- one is colored in "blue" and other in "red".
Expected Time Complexity: O(n*m)
Expected Space Complexity: O(n*m)

Constraints:
1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500
grid[i][j] = {'0', '1'}
