N-Queen Problem
Difficulty: HardAccuracy: 35.43%Submissions: 84K+Points: 8
The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on a (n√ón) chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other.
Given an integer n, find all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle. Each solution contains distinct board configurations of the n-queens placement, where the solutions are a permutation of [1,2,3..n] in increasing order, here the number in the ith place denotes that the ith-column queen is placed in the row with that number. For eg below figure represents a chessboard [3 1 4 2].



Examples:

Input: 1
Output: [1]
Explaination: Only one queen can be placed in the single cell available.
Input: 4
Output: [[2 4 1 3 ],[3 1 4 2 ]]
Explaination: These are the 2 possible solutions.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n!)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n2)
